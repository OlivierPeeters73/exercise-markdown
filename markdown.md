# What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or *italic*, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## Examples:

### Unordered list:
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
    * Item 3a
    * Item 3b

### Ordered list:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
